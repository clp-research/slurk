Layouts and Plugins
=========================================

In Slurk you have the possibility to integrate your own layouts.
With layouts it is possible to modify the right side and specify a stylesheet.

A layout is a JSON file with a top level dictionary with the following keys:

- ``"title"``: String displayed in the header. If no title is specified, "Slurk" is used.
- ``"subtitle"``: String displayed under the title.
- ``"html"``: Consists of a list of further dictionaries or strings.
    Each dictionary represents an HTML node.  Each key in this dictionary corresponds to the attribute in an HTML tag. There are also two predefined tags: ``"layout-type"`` and ``"layout-content"``. ``"layout-type"`` corresponds to the name of the node, ``"layout-content"`` corresponds to the content between the opening and closing tag. For example

    .. code-block:: json

      {
        "layout-type": "span",
        "layout-content": "text",
        "id": "box"
      }

    corresponds to the HTML of ``<span id="box">Text</span>``
- ``"css"``: A dictionary, which is similar to a typical css stylesheet. Example:
    .. code-block:: json

       {
         "#image-area": {
           "align-content": "left",
           "margin": "50px 20px 15px"
         }
       }
- ``"script"``: Provides the ability to inject a script plugin into the chat. It consists of another dictionary, which maps different triggers to scripts or a list of scripts. Scripts can either lie in *app/static/plugins* or can be passed by link. Example:

    .. code-block:: json

      {
        "incoming-message": "display-message",
        "submit-message": "send-message",
        "print-history": "plain-history"
      }

These are the currently defined triggers:

- ``"incoming-message"``: Called, when a new message arrives. These are the passed parameters
    - ``data.user``: The user, who has send the message
    - ``data.timestamp``: The timestamp of the message
    - ``data.privateMessage``: A boolean value if this was a direct message or visible to the room
    - ``data.msg`` (Optional): The message string the sent message if any
    - ``data.image`` (Optional): The image url of the sent message if any (Either ``data.msg`` or ``data.image`` are available)
    - ``data.width`` (Optional): The width of the sent image (available if ``data.image`` is set)
    - ``data.height`` (Optional): The height of the sent image (available if ``data.image`` is set)
- ``"submit-message"``: Called, when the user hits RETURN on the typing area
    - ``text``: The text which was entered in the typing area
    - ``current_user``: The user, which just hit RETURN
    - ``current_timestamp``: The current timestamp
- ``"print-history"``: Triggered, when the server sends the history of the chat on joining a room
    - ``element.type``: Type of the event. Either ``"text"``, ``"command"`` or ``"status"``
    - ``element.user``: The user who send the event
    - ``element.timestamp``: The timestamp of the event
    - ``element.msg`` (``"text"``): The message of the text event
    - ``element.receiver_id`` (``"text"``, Optional): The receiver id, if it was a private message
    - ``element.command`` (``"command"``): The command which was executed
- ``"print-history"``: Triggered, when the server sends the history of the chat on joining a room
- ``"document-ready"``: Inserted into the JQuery ``$(document).ready`` function
- ``"plain"``: Inserted as plain script into the chat
- ``"typing-users"``: Triggered when a user starts or stops typing
    - ``users``: A map of currently typing users, with it's id as the key

Additional, some functions are guarantied to exist:

- ``display_message(sender, time, message, privateMessage)``
- ``display_image(sender, time, url, width, height, privateMessage)``
- ``display_info(time, message)``
- ``submit_text(text)``
- ``submit_image(url, width, height)``
- ``submit_command(parameter)``


******************************
Layout development in practice
******************************

Creating and adding your own layout to Slurk allows you to customize the design and functionality of the waiting and chat room without changing the static HTML and CSS files. It is possible to define and format new tags or to work with existing ones.

The following steps demonstrate how to build your own layout, using snippets from the layout for the *CoLA*-game as examples.

Customizing the existing ``waiting_room`` layout
------------------------------------------------

First of all, you should consider checking whether you want to modify the ``waiting_room`` layout which will be loaded by default when the Waiting Room is created (*see app/main/database.py, line 136*).

*EXAMPLE:*

The CoLA waiting room is supposed to have a different title (l. 2), a different image (l. 12) and a blue theme (l. 23):

    .. code-block:: json

        {
          "title": "CoLA - Waiting Room",
          "subtitle": "Waiting for another player...",
          "html": [
            {
              "layout-type": "div",
              "id": "image-area",
              "layout-content": [
                {
                  "layout-type": "image",
                  "id": "current-image",
                  "src": "https://dsg.lili.uni-bielefeld.de:8000/cola_data/The-Waiting-Room.jpg",
                  "width": 500,
                  "height": 400
                }
              ]
            },
            [...]
          ],
          "css": {
            "header, footer": {
              "background": "#115E91"
            },
            [...]
          },
          "scripts": {
            [...]
          }
        }



The Main Layout
---------------

The main layout defines **your** chatroom and it will be loaded as soon as a *New Task Room* is opened.
By default, the ``pairup-bot`` will load the ``meetup_task``-layout.
In order to use yours you need to replace "meetup_task" with the name of your layout (*see pairup_bot.py, line 159*).
Here it would be "cola_task" (assuming that a file *cola_task.json* was created in /app/static/layouts).

*EXAMPLE:*

The CoLA chatroom has to be able to, e.g. display images (on the right side of the chatroom). In order to display several images belonging to different categories in a structured way a table can be used. How can this be realized in the layout?

**HTML:**

1. Specify the area where the table should lie (ll. 5-7).
2. Define the table (ll. 9,10).
3. Define the first row of the table (ll. 12,13).
4. Define the first cell of the first row (ll. 15,16).
5. Define an image-tag inside the first cell of the first row (ll. 18-23).
   Now there is a placeholder with the id **r0c0** for one image. Its *src*-attribute can be enriched with a value anytime.
6. Define the second cell of the first row (ll. 28,29).
7. Define an image-tag in the second cell of the first row (ll. 31-36)
8. Etc.

    .. code-block:: json
    
        {
          "title": "CoLA - Chatroom",
          "html": [
            {
              "layout-type": "div",
              "id": "show-area",
              "layout-content": [
                {
                  "layout-type": "table",
                  "layout-content": [
                    {
                      "layout-type": "tr",
                      "layout-content": [
                        {
                          "layout-type": "td",
                          "layout-content": [
                            {
                              "layout-type": "image",
                              "id": "r0c0",
                              "src": "",
                              "class": "hidden",
                              "width": 128,
                              "height": 128
                            }
                          ]
                        },
                        {
                          "layout-type": "td",
                          "layout-content": [
                            {
                              "layout-type": "image",
                              "id": "r0c1",
                              "src": "",
                              "class": "hidden",
                              "width": 128,
                              "height": 128
                            }
                          ]
                        },
                        [...]
                    ]}
                ]}
            ]}
        ]}

**CSS:**

1. Format the area where the table lies, referring to it by its ID (ll. 2-8).
2. Format the table (ll. 10-19).
3. Etc.

    .. code-block:: json

        "css": {
            "#show-area": {
              "display": "block",
              "margin-left": "auto",
              "margin-right": "auto",
              "width": "900px",
              "background-color": "rgb(182, 226, 226)"
            },
            "table": {
              "display": "block",
              "margin-left": "auto",
              "margin-right": "auto",
              "margin-bottom": "20px",
              "padding-top": "20px",
              "padding-bottom": "20px",
              "width": "840px",
              "border-collapse": "collapse",
              "border-spacing": "0"
            },
            [...]
        }



Plugin development in practice
------------------------------

You can use plugins to implement additional client-side functionality to Slurk. The steps neccessary to do this are illustrated below, using the example of a simple mechanism for capturing mouse clicks. Creating and injecting a new plugin consists of the following steps:

1)  Choosing an appropriate trigger

    Depending on the functionality you want to add to Slurk, you can choose between different triggers. Mouse clicks neither depend on messages nor the chat history, therefore the trigger ``"document-ready"`` is used.

2)  Creating the plugin file

    Create a new JavaScript file and save it in the directory */app/static/plugins*, using an appropriate name (e.g. "mouse-clicks.js").

    Add the necessary code to the file:

      .. code-block:: javascript

          var mousePos = {x:undefined, y:undefined};
          var offset;

          function getPosition (e, area) {
              offset = $(area).offset();
              mousePos.x = e.clientX - offset.left;
              mousePos.y = e.clientY - offset.top;
              }

          $("#current-image").click(function(evt){
              getPosition(evt, "#current-image");
              socket.emit('mousePosition', {
                  type:'click',
                  element:"#current-image",
                  coordinates:mousePos,
                  room:self_room
              });
          });

3)  Injecting the plugin

    Inject your plugin to Slurk by adding trigger and plugin (without the file extension) to the ``"script"`` dictionary in the layout file you're using:

      .. code-block:: json

        "script": {
          "document-ready": "mouse-clicks"
        }

    The JavaScript code is now embedded as follows:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        $(document).ready(function(){

          var mousePosition = {x:undefined, y:undefined};
          var offset;

          function getPosition (e, area) {
            [...]
          }

          $("#current-image").click(function(evt){
            [...]
          });

        });
